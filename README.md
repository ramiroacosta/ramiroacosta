## 👨🏻‍💻 About Me

🔭  &nbsp;As a Systems Engineering student with a strong foundation in programming (JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and C++) and basic networking knowledge, I am passionate about exploring new technologies and creating innovative solutions.\

💼  &nbsp;Available for collaborations in software development, pro bono consulting, or mentorship, especially in team environments where I bring my bilingual proficiency in Portuguese and experience mentoring newcomers.\
💡 &nbsp; Always eager to learn and grow, I seek opportunities to bridge technology and law, contributing to meaningful discussions and real-world applications.\
